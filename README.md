# MyREPO
This is my learnyounode repo. 

Goal of this repo is to keep track of my progress doing the learnyounode excercises. 
I'm really enjoying these, difficulty scales up nicely (even though i had more issues solving the "Juggling Async" problem than with the "Time Server" problem. )

So far I've done these: 
* Hello World
* Baby steps
* My first IO
* My first async IO
* Filtered LS
* Make it modular
* HTTP Client
* HTTP Collect
* Juggling Async <= need to redo this one
* Time Server
* File Server
* HTTP UpperCaser
* HTTP Json API Server

TO-DO: 
Nothing, I finished this series. It's been nice, and I want to redo some excercises.
